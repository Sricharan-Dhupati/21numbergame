# 21game
This is an program that plays the 21 game with you!

21 is a 2 player game, in which the one has to take turns and say 3 consecutive numbers, the other picks up where the one left.
The one to say the number 21 wins.

This program is specifically written to make you lose at the game.

This is one of my first programs 

Feel free to make changes and let me know if I can improve on anything.
