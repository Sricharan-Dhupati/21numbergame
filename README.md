# 21game
This is a program that plays the 21 game with you!

21 is game in which players take turns and say 3 consecutive numbers, the other player picks up from where the first player left.
The one to say the number 21 losses.

This program is specifically written to make you lose at the game.

This is one of my first programs.

Feel free to make changes and let me know if I can improve on anything.
